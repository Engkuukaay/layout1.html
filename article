<h1>History of Mogadishu Stadium</h1>
<p>The facility was constructed in 1977 during the Siad Barre administration, with the assistance of Chinese engineers.<br>
    Although Mogadishu Stadium was mainly used for hosting sporting activities, presidential addresses and political rallies<br>
    were also held there.[1]In 1987, the popular singer Magool staged the famous "Mogadishu and Magool" concert at basketball hall<br>
    (adjacent to football stadium) which is part of this wide sports facility/village. It was among the largest such musical events held at the time, with thousands of people in attendance.</p>
